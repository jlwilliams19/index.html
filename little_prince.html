         <p>
            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
            <u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u>
            <mark>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</mark>
            In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind,
            and I said to myself:
            <em>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</em>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
            <em>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the 
                image of a rose that shines through his whole being like  the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</em>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still. <u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame 
                that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</u>
